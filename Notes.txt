INTERESTING THINGS:


ERRORS:
> Escape key didn't leave the battle screen
- I was using ==, not =, that's why.

> Player ground value changes if the player leaves the battle screen and returns.
- This was happening because each time the player.load method was called, it reduced the ground value by the player's height. I changed the code to be a constant instead of referencing itself.

> Health bar became huge
- This was happening because the ratio of the health bar actually increased the length rather than reducing it because it was over the prototype '100' I changed it to be health/maxhealth

> Movement in air halted when value is 0,0
- IN PROGRESS

> Knockback wrong direction
- Facing in the takehit method had to be reversed because it was considering the local object's facing direction. Reversing it makes it refer to the opposing object's director.
